"""Dashboard route blueprints.

Chatbox policy (per references/viewer-spec.md): the chat blueprint is
registered ONLY when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in the environment. With no
key, the dashboard renders without a chat sidebar (the Jinja2
`{% if chat_enabled %}` guard in templates/dashboard.html omits the
chat HTML, so users never see a dead input field).

Other route imports (coverage/catalog/creation/rays/ase/segmentation) are
guarded with try/except so a missing module doesn't crash the whole app —
the restored web/ is a partial port from older commits and not all
blueprints have been brought forward yet.
